# Book Recommendation Design Documentation

## Overview

The Book recommendation system aims to help users discover new books based on their preferences and provide personalized recommendations. It addresses the challenges of finding relevant books in all available options.

## Project Problem Pitch

Once you have your group and an idea, you will need to create a short pitch deck that includes:

**Name of Project**: Book Recommendation System

**What problem are you solving?**
With a vast number of available books across different genres, users may struggle to find books that they would enjoy. This book recommendation system will pick the top 10 book recommendations based on the genre, rating, authors, and user feedback to suggest relevant books to users.

**Who/What does the project interface with?**
- The project interfaces with book databases or APIs such as IMDb to gather information about books, including genres, ratings, and user reviews. It also interacts with the user interface to capture user preferences and display recommendations.

**What are the inputs?**
- User's favorite book or other preferences: Users can provide their preferred genres, authors, or books they have enjoyed.
- User ratings: Users can rate books they have read to refine the recommendations further.

**What are the outputs?**
- Personalized book recommendations.
- Book details: title, year, genre, author, ratings.

**List 5 steps to go from input -> output**
1. User input: Capture user preferences, such as favorite genres, authors, or books they have enjoyed.
2. Data collection: Fetch book data from the book database or API, including genres, ratings, and reviews.
3. Recommendation algorithm: Develop an algorithm that analyzes user preferences and ratings to generate personalized book recommendations.
4. Display recommendations: Present the generated book recommendations to the user along with relevant book details and information.
5. User interaction: Allow users to rate books they have read, which can be used to refine future recommendations.

**What's the biggest risk?**
- The size of the database.
- Recommendations might not be accurate or relevant for a specific user.
- Relying on an API to work.

**How will you know you're successful?**
- Users can input their preferences and receive at least 90% accurate recommendations.
- The system integrates seamlessly with the book database or API to fetch book data.
- The project adheres to PEP8 style guidelines.
- The project includes a testing plan with appropriate unit tests.
